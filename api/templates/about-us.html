            <h2>I just wanna keep track of when my shows get released.</h2>
            <p class="about-text">This project started for that reason alone. After Korea started pumping out KDrama after KDrama and my watchlist grew,
                I got overwhelmed and forgot when the shows I watched weekly would be released. I could list it down manually, but after learning the basics of web development
                and programming, I realized this was a perfect use-case of what I've studied so far.
                <br><br>
                I hope that Kalendar will help you in the same way it's helped me. Kalendar is for everyone who needs structure in the chaotic world of KDramas.
